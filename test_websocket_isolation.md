# WebSocket Isolation Test

## Problem Fixed

The original issue was that when a WebSocket connection to a chat room was disconnected, the entire API Gateway would stop running. This happened because:

1. **Blocking Handler**: The WebSocket handler function was blocking the HTTP server thread
2. **No Goroutine Isolation**: Each WebSocket connection wasn't properly isolated
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Errors in one connection could affect the entire server

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Goroutine Isolation

- Moved WebSocket connection handling to a separate `handleWebSocketConnection` function
- Each WebSocket connection now runs in its own goroutine
- The HTTP handler immediately returns after starting the goroutine

### 2. Proper Cleanup

- Added `defer` statements for proper resource cleanup
- Each connection is properly closed when it ends
- gRPC streams are properly closed with `defer stream.CloseSend()`

### 3. Graceful Shutdown

- Added graceful shutdown handling with signal catching
- Server waits for outstanding requests to complete before shutting down
- Added proper timeouts to prevent hanging connections

### 4. Better Error Handling

- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Errors in one connection don't affect others
- Proper error propagation and cleanup

## Key Changes Made

1. **Refactored WebSocket Handler**:

   ```go
   // Before: Blocking handler
   mux.HandleFunc("/api/v1/ws/rooms/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       // ... blocking code ...
       <-done  // This blocked the HTTP server
   })

   // After: Non-blocking handler
   mux.HandleFunc("/api/v1/ws/rooms/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       // ... setup code ...
       go handleWebSocketConnection(conn, roomID, chatClient)  // Non-blocking
   })
   ```

2. **Isolated Connection Management**:

   ```go
   func handleWebSocketConnection(conn *websocket.Conn, roomID int, chatClient messagepb.MessageServiceClient) {
       defer func() {
           log.Printf("WS: room=%d disconnect", roomID)
           conn.Close()
       }()
       // ... connection logic ...
   }
   ```

3. **Graceful Shutdown**:

   ```go
   // Wait for interrupt signal
   quit := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
   signal.Notify(quit, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
   <-quit

   // Graceful shutdown with timeout
   shutdownCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
   defer cancel()
   server.Shutdown(shutdownCtx)
   ```

## Testing the Fix

To test that the fix works:

1. **Start the gateway**: `./gateway`
2. **Connect to multiple rooms**: Open WebSocket connections to different room IDs
3. **Disconnect one room**: Close one WebSocket connection
4. **Verify others work**: Other rooms should continue working
5. **Verify gateway runs**: The gateway should continue running and accepting new connections

## Benefits

- ✅ **Isolation**: Disconnecting one room doesn't affect others
- ✅ **Reliability**: Gateway continues running even if individual connections fail
- ✅ **Scalability**: Can handle multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Better error handling and logging
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Server shuts down cleanly when needed
